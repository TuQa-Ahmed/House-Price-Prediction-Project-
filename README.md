My House Price Prediction Project! üè°
I recently completed a project where I developed a predictive model for house prices using machine learning techniques. This hands-on experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of various essential skills and methodologies in data science.
Project Overview:
In this project, I utilized the Kaggle House Prices dataset to predict house prices based on various features
Key Steps in the Process:
1. Data Exploration:
Analyzed the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, and explore relationships between features and the target variable (Sale Price).

2. Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned the data by handling missing values and scaling features for better model performance.

3. Model Training:
Implemented a Linear Regression model to predict house prices, which provided insightful results and a solid foundation for further improvement.

4. Evaluation Metrics:
Used metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the model's performance, achieving an MAE of approximately 29,297, which reflects a reasonable accuracy for predictions.

Skills Acquired:
Data Cleaning and Preparation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model Development and Evaluation
Proficiency in Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
